    <h2>Description</h2>
     <p>Fettuccine Alfredo is a classic, creamy Italian pasta dish. It's a favorite among kids since it's so cheesy! It's different from white pasta sauce, which starts with a flour and butter base. Alfredo sauce is made with Parmesan, heavy cream, and butter.</p>
     <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
        <li>Fettuccine pasta: 12 ounces</li>
        <li>Butter: 1 cup (2 sticks)</li>
        <li>Heavy cream: 1 cup</li>
        <li>Garlic: 2 cloves, minced</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese: 1 cup, freshly grated</li>
        <li>Salt: to taste</li>
        <li>Black pepper: to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped parsley: for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
