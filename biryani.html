        <li>1 cup yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>2-3 green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped cilantro (coriander leaves)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped mint leaves</li>
        <li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves</li>
        <li>2-3 green cardamom pods</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons red chili powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons biryani masala</li>
        <li>4 cups water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee or oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
     <h4>Steps</h4>
     <ol>
        <li>Wash and soak the basmati rice in water for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat ghee or oil in a large pan. Add bay leaves, cloves, cardamom pods, and cumin seeds. Saut√© for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the sliced onions to the pan and cook until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Stir in the ginger-garlic paste and green chilies. Cook for a few minutes until the raw smell disappears.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they are soft and the oil begins to separate.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken or mutton pieces and cook until they are browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Mix in the turmeric powder, red chili powder, biryani masala, and salt. Cook for a few minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Pour in the yogurt and cook until the meat is tender and cooked through, about 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a separate large pot, bring water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt and the soaked, drained rice. Cook the rice until it is 70% cooked (it should still have a bite to it). Drain the rice.</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat mixture in the pan.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle chopped cilantro and mint leaves over the rice.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to finish cooking.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let it sit for 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        <li>Gently fluff the biryani with a fork before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
